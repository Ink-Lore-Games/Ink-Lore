A comprehensive document on Resonance - the living, semi-sentient energy that shapes identity, emotion, and power in Auralis. Explore its manifestations as Echoes, Anchors, and Harmonics, learn about the dangers of Discordance and understand the social hierarchy tied to resonance ability
# Chapter 1: Introduction
Resonance is a semi-sentient frequency that affects all life. It is a living energy related to emotions, memory, and identity. Every person interacts with this field in some way, according to their emotional state, memories, and sense of core identity. Most people emit small, passive resonance signals, but some can shape and use it in more impactful ways.
# Chapter 2: Manifestation
Resonance manifests in many ways for different users, physically showing their abilities and mental state. Each user’s resonance normally follows a primary theme or subject, with an occasional secondary theme that is usually animalistic. This theme reflects the user’s personality or emotions—for example, an energetic resonance user may have electricity as a theme. Stronger resonance users have elements of pure resonance that appear on their person, the amount of it usually showing their power level, though that is not always the case. Most of this is seemingly purely cosmetic, but some have a more practical use, as detailed below.
## 2.1 Echoes
Echoes are fragments or "footprints" of a person's resonance. Most echoes are stored within objects, Harmonics, or places, creating an extension or "snapshot" of the user’s resonance at the time of creation. They often form at important emotional points in the user’s life, or as the remains of their energy once they are gone. The second of which usually appears as Echo Flowers—a small flower that grows on the grave of a resonance user. These flowers’ appearance reflects the user and contains an echo from the moment of death, often reflecting their emotional state during that moment, or the cause of it.
## 2.2 Anchors
Anchors are made of pure, solidified resonance that contain a powerful echo of the user. These act as vessels to help channel and concentrate the user’s resonance. Their appearance reflects the user but is always translucent, resembling coloured glass or jelly. These are often created at an important moment in the wearer’s life or journey and can shift or break with emotional turmoil or identity change. While some will simply appear as small objects or accessories worn or carried by the user, some will appear more directly as weapons or tools for the user to channel their resonance through.
## 2.2 Harmonics
Harmonics are semi-autonomous, living manifestations of resonance. They have two different forms: active and dormant. In their active form, they are able to move about freely and appear as a separate creature to the user, often with animalistic traits. In their dormant form, they turn into normal anchors that are usually worn or carried by the user. Harmonics can only stay in their active form for a limited period of time before returning to their dormant form to recharge. The energy level of both active and dormant harmonics can be seen through their transparency. If a harmonic is not returned to its dormant state before it runs out of energy, it will go fully transparent and appear to disappear, but it will eventually reappear in its dormant state. The energy level of a harmonic seemingly has no effect on its use as an anchor; it simply limits its ability to act independently of the user.
# Chapter 3: Discordance
There are a few instances of "negative" resonance, more commonly known as discordance. Discordance is wild and uncontrollable, often having harmful side effects and consequences for those who try to wield it. Whilst there are not many documented cases of those who try to tame these effects, there is evidence of a group of nulls that call themselves "Oblivion" and aim to use discordance to give themselves resonance abilities despite the danger it may cause. In these individuals, discordance appears mostly the same as typical resonance but seems to always require an anchor, as none have been spotted without one.
There also exist wild and aggressive discordant harmonics called Aberrants or The Chorus, depending on how they formed.
## 3.1 Aberrants
Aberrants are unnatural constructs that appear to have been created through artificial means; they are often unstable, grotesque, and dangerous. The majority of the more stable ones seem to have a mainly mechanical structure, with organic resonance parts melding into them. These are theorized to have been created through unethical experiments run by Oblivion, although their true origin is currently unknown.
## 3.2 The Chorus
The Chorus are naturally forming harmonics born from fear, guilt, doubt, and other negative emotions. These whisper, or chorus, intrusive thoughts to their victim, seemingly trying to feed off their resonance by weakening it through emotional vulnerability. They can overwhelm individuals, leading to mental and emotional breakdowns. They are often physical representations of someone's internal conflict and tend to go after strong resonance users.
# Chapter 4: Resonance Hierarchy
Most people in the world possess some level of resonance, which influences their social standing and power. Resonance abilities come in different levels, as outlined below.
## 0 - Nulls  
_Description:_ Individuals with no detectable resonance  
_Social status:_ Socially marginalized and looked down upon.
## 1 - Sparks  
_Description:_ Minor resonance traits or passive effects such as heightened senses or night vision.  
_Social status:_ Commonplace, mild recognition.
## 2 - Embers  
_Description:_ Possess 1–2 more powerful abilities such as producing and controlling small amounts of flame or generating small protective shields. They may also have physical manifestations of resonance, but they are purely cosmetic.  
_Social status:_ More respected and often given specific jobs where they can make use of their abilities.
## 3 - Anchored  
_Description:_ Have a range of different powers/abilities around a central theme. They will normally have created an anchor at this point or have the power level to create one.  
_Social status:_ Respected; this is the point where they will get an invitation to their local resonance academy.
## 4 - Harmonic Bonded  
_Description:_ Possess a living, semi-autonomous resonance partner called a harmonic. Usually have a wide skill set of abilities.  
_Social status:_ Often celebrated or feared; most heroes fall inside this category.
## 5 - Prisms  
_Description:_ So deeply attuned to resonance that they blur the line between human and harmonic. Prisms are said to embody a specific domain (e.g., Mortality, Echoes), and may bear crystalline wings formed of pure resonance. Not all who gain wings become Prisms, and not all Prisms display wings, but to bear them is to walk the line between self and something greater.  
_Social status:_ God-like figures of myth and legend. No proven cases exist, only whispers and tales.
# Chapter 5: Conclusion
While much has been documented about Resonance, including its forms, uses, and impact, many mysteries still remain, especially regarding the ever-growing threat of Discordance and the true nature of Prisms. Scholars and practitioners alike continue to study and explore this energy, seeking a deeper understanding and striving to unlock its full potential. As Auralis evolves, so too will the relationship its people share with this living energy. The future of Resonance remains uncertain, but it is clear that those who master it will shape the destiny of the world itself
